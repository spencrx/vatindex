Hiring the right VAT accountant saves you from compliance headaches, surprise penalties, and messy re-filings.

## When you actually need one
- You sell to EU customers (digital services, SaaS, or goods)
- You store inventory in the EU
- You register for VAT in any EU country
- You need OSS / IOSS support

## What to look for
- Proven experience with startups and cross-border VAT
- Clear process for registrations, filings, and deadlines
- Ability to advise on OSS vs local registrations
- Strong communication (fast replies, plain-language answers)

## Questions to ask
- Which countries do you cover directly?
- Do you support OSS filings?
- What’s your turnaround time for questions?
- What do you need from me each month/quarter?
- How do you handle corrections and late filings?

## Red flags

- Vague pricing or “it depends” with no range
- Slow responses before you’ve even paid
- No examples of similar clients
- They can’t explain VAT in plain English
